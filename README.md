# Predicting Redistribution Preferences: The Role of Educational Mobility, Social Attitudes, and Machine Learning Approaches


---

## Project Overview

This project explores how intergenerational **educational mobility**, **social attitudes**, and **institutional factors** shape public preferences toward income redistribution across Europe. Unlike traditional studies that focus on correlations, this project applies machine learning techniques to **predict redistribution preferences** and uncover the most influential drivers.

The goal is to predict whether an individual:
- **Supports redistribution**
- **Is neutral**
- **Opposes redistribution**

## Project Structure

### Processed Datasets:

- **`dataset_for_model_training/`** – Cleaned and engineered datasets used for model training.
  - Includes versions tailored for different model architectures (e.g., categorical, numeric).
  
- **[`combined_data.csv`](combined_data.csv)** – Merged and raw dataset (post-integration, pre-cleaning).

### Notebooks:
- **[`ees_dataset_combine_(2).ipynb`](ees_dataset_combine_(2).ipynb)** – Prepares and merges survey datasets, cleaning and structuring them for analysis.
- **[`full_code.ipynb`](full_code.ipynb)** – A comprehensive notebook that integrates both data processing, visualization, and modelling.


### Additional File:
- **[`final_report.pdf`](final_report.pdf)** – Formal academic report with key findings, visuals, and discussion.
